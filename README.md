# Coding-Challenge-9
This is the repository for the Coding Challenge 9 assignment for ISM 3232. This challenge allows us to create several classes: Book, Section, Patron, VIPPatron. There are also several methods created in each class, allowing us to run a successful library and manage our books and their availability.
